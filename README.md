Description: 
We want to create a campus event management system that allows the student club to manage events and attendees. Organizers are able to create and manage events, handle club members and registration, and also track attendance in this application. The entire system is designed to support student club activities by giving organizers a place to manage event details and overall tracking. 

Core features:
1.Event Management: create, edit and delete events where each event has a title,time,date, location, description and capacity limits (organizers can update even information if details change)

2.Member Management: add, delete and edit members where each member has name, phone number, student ID and email. (the system keeps all member information in one place so organizers don;t have to manage different spreadsheets for members)

3.Event registration: member can be registered to an event(prevent duplicate registration for the same event), this will ensure the sign up list are accurate and events do not go beyond maximum limits., 

4.attendence tracking, for each single event, mark and track which registered members actually attended

5.Event and attendance views, list upcoming events and view event details including the list of registered members and number of attendees  

The Campus Event Management system will be implemented in Java using OOD and will create corresponding UML crafts. we plan to use simple GUI(Java swing) for the user interface
